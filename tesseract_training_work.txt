1) I am following the following tutorial using his old english document which can be downloaded there
http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/02/11/adding-new-fonts-to-tesseract-3-ocr-engine/#create-training-documents

2) To run the "convert" command specified you have to install ImageMagick and ghostscript
ImageMagick: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows
ghostscript: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/?source=typ_redirect

3) Additionally, the syntax for conversion is for unix, the windows syntax (with monochrome added for good measure) is 
   'convert -density 300x300 -depth 4 -monochrome lang.font-name.exp0.pdf lang.font-name.exp0.tif'

4) To run tesseract in the first training step the path to the executable must be in your path 
   also the location of the output file can't be in the Program file folder

5) Matched box and text file lengths by using Winmerge to compare value and finding miss gaps

6) Change text to utf8 encoding before merging with box file

7) exe on executables


Maybe?
