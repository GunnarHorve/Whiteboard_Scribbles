1) I am following the following tutorial using his old english document which can be downloaded there
http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2012/02/11/adding-new-fonts-to-tesseract-3-ocr-engine/#create-training-documents

2) To run the "convert" command specified you have to install ImageMagick and ghostscript
ImageMagick: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows
ghostscript: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/?source=typ_redirect

3) Additionally, the syntax for conversion is for unix, the windows syntax (with monochrome added for good measure) is 
   'convert -density 300x300 -depth 4 -monochrome lang.font-name.exp0.pdf lang.font-name.exp0.tif'

4) To run tesseract in the first training step the path to the executable must be in your path 
   also the location of the output file can't be in the Program file folder

5) Now I am looking for a functioning box file editor to correct errors in the box file
