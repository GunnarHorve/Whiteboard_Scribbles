1. Install tesseract: 
https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

2. Install pytesser: 
pycharm -> file -> settings -> Project: Whitebaord_Scribbles -> Project Interpreter. 
	a. Press the green + button to add a new module. 
	b. Search for pytesseract and click "Install Package"

3. The module will be installed in Python27/Lib/site-packages/pytesseract. According to the following documentation, 
pytesser must be installed in the same file as the script using it.

Move the contents of pytesseract into Whiteboard_Scribbles/TestPkg1

4. Need to specify the tesseract.exe location if it is not added as a path variable.  
	a. Open pytesseract.py
	b. Search tesseract_cmd
	c. Change the string to TESSERACT_INSTALLATION\\tesseract.exe. For me, it was the following:
	'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe'

5. Select a test image, add it to the images folder if desired, and use the following test Code:
	from PIL import Image
	import pytesseract

	img = Image.open('images/test.png')
	test = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
	print(test)
